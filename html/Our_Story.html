        <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            IPS teachers have not had a pay increase in 6 years. Teachers who’ve taught in IPS for 8-10 years  have not received a pay increase for the majority of their career. Tina, IPS’ 2014 Teacher of the Year, recently had a baby and is constantly balancing the cost of daycare with no pay raise; Meca, a mom of 4 and a brilliant special education teacher, considers teaching in IPS her ‘dream job,’ must re-evaluate whether or not she can afford to keep the job she loves; Abby, who mentors two first year teachers at her school and serves as a leader in the union, has to constantly balance her commitment to her school and the reality that keeping her job can become unaffordable;  and Eddie is stuck at the pay level he was at during his first year as a teacher.</p>
          <p>
            Each of these teachers have gone above and beyond for their kids - outside of the classroom. Meca is coaching an 11 year old female student on how to advocate for easing the uniform policy at a school board meeting. When one of her students became pregnant, Tina became the godmother to her child’s baby, and helped her get back to school to graduate. For another student, Tina paid a student’s cell phone bill when he couldn’t, gave him lunch money, and helped him make up his missing assignments when he was in juvenile detention. When this student was accepted to college, Tina drove him there, met with the school’s administrators and paid his room and board down payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meca and Abby was recipients of the Human Rights Award for United Education Profession of the Indianapolis Education Association.  Eddie was named Teacher of the year for his school; Tina was named teacher of the year for all of Indianapolis Public Schools. Despite their outstanding track record as teacher leaders, they could make great impact on behalf of kids and make more money if they go somewhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers also churn through the system, forced to re-build community ties wherever they go; Abby’s taught for 9 years, and has move schools XX times. Tina was forced to move schools due to district changes, and may move again as her current high school will be absorbed by another school. Each new school means joining a new community, forging new, complicated and difficult student relationships, developing trust with new colleagues, and finding new joy in a new environment. As many teachers who’ve experienced this churn will say, going to a new school is almost like your first year of teaching all over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            When great teachers leave - due to low pay or a forced move by the district - students lose out the most.  Everyone knows at Shortridge that Mrs. Ahlgren is the one to go to if you’re struggling with math. As one student said ‘she sticks with you, no matter what.’ If Mrs. Ahlgren has to leave IPS, hundreds of students lose their last best shot at being ready to graduate and be ready for the real world. The student that spent time incarcerated would have never made it to college; the pregnant teenager would have dropped out and never finished high school. When great teachers leave, students lose.
          </p>
          <p>
            With school closings, school leadership changes, a change in Superintendent and a recent history of unclear school board policies, teachers have acutely felt the churn of policy. If the IPS leadership expects to revamp other policies and ensure kids receive the best education possible, they must do it with teacher buy-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            IPS teachers cannot afford to teach and raise their families on their salaries. Last year, Tina had a baby. At ten years into her career, her salary ought to make it affordable to both teach and pay for childcare. However, she’s stuck at a salary point that ensures most of her teaching salary goes directly to paying for childcare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eddie, who was nominated as his building’s teacher of the year, has had job opportunities elsewhere – both at schools outside of IPS and as an instructional coach with other organizations. He loves his kids, classroom and school, and has therefore not taken them. However, he’s not had a raise since he started teaching, and living on a first year teacher’s salary is making taking those jobs even harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also cannot discuss elevating the perception of the teaching profession when every other district around you pays teachers better, with less of the challenges an urban district like IPS faces. If salaries are not competitive AND you have the professional strain of working in an urban district, IPS cannot remain competitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            IPS has an opportunity to elevate the teaching profession, and ensure that they have a highly skilled teaching force committed to their school communities for the long term. By pushing the district to close the compensation gap, the district will have buy-in from teachers to implement policy changes necessary to elevating the teaching profession – implementing a growth-oriented evaluation system, applying a teacher ladder pay structure, and providing exemplary teachers paid opportunities to share their education experience through professional development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a future with stabilized compensation, teachers will be more amenable to change. Teachers would actively engage in the conversations around changes in evaluation, be excited by the opportunity to share their knowledge through professional development, and critically engage in what a fair, professional compensation model would look like. First, though, they need a break. IPS still has a long way to go before becoming an exemplary district, and much of that burden will fall on the shoulders of teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make these complicated, potentially painful changes, teachers need to feel financially secure and know the district is invested in them professionally. Great teachers like Tina, 
            Abby, Eddie and Meca should not have to constantly worry about whether or not they and their families can afford for them to remain teachers in IPS. They, and all teachers like them, should be free to invest their intellectual resources in teaching children and developing into even stronger educators. This future can only happen, though, if the district invests in them first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students benefit most by a direct investment in teachers. By ensuring that great teachers choose to teach in IPS, hundreds of students will have access to everything that Mrs. Ahlgren, Mrs. Perkins-Knight, Mrs. Taylor and Mr. Rangel have to offer. Great teachers will build deep relationships within the communities they’ve come to know, and have the freedom to build strong connections with students and families. In the end, a direct investment in great teachers will mean material benefits for students and the greater community around the school.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are asking educators in the room to help us build a movement that provides teachers with financial security, so they can focus on educating their students and elevating the teaching profession to the status the title ‘teacher’ deserves.
