        <p><em>Elevate IPS</em> is a grassroots, IPS teacher-led team advocating for our fellow teachers and all of the students in all of our classrooms. We are working to ensure that all students in IPS have access to high quality, well compensated teachers. We believe that our district is in jeopardy of losing its best teachers because we are forced to choose between the kids in our classroom and our families. We believe that if we work together, we can elevate compensation for quality teachers so that all kids in our district have access to great educators.</p>
        <p>Elevate IPS is the brainchild of four IPS teachers â€“ Tina Ahlgren, LaMeca Perkins-Knight, Eddie Rangel and Abby Taylor. After attending community organizing trainings sponsored by Teach Plus, Tina, Meca, Eddie and Abby decided they wanted to engage their fellow teachers on the topic of teacher compensation. To support our work, Teach Plus awarded Elevate IPS a grant.</p>
        <p>Over the upcoming months, Elevate IPS will work to gather and publicize stories from teachers around the district. Why did you decide to become a teacher? When have you had to make the tough choice between the kids in your classroom, and your own families? What inspires you most about the amazing students you work with every day?</p>
